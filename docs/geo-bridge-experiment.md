# Geographic Bridge Holdout Report

`extrachill/get-geo-bridge-experiment` reports only `geo-bridge-holdout` on
`single-post-bridge`, with the declared `control` and `treatment` variants. It
is a private, read-only ability and is not a general experimentation API.

## Event Contract

- `experiment_assignment` enters an identified person into a variant denominator.
- `experiment_exposure` records actual server-validated 50% viewport exposure.
- `bridge_click` remains an independently lossy stored event. Click events are
  neither deduplicated nor clamped, while unique clickers are reported separately.
- `pageview` supplies the first identified cross-blog route transition after each
  assignment and exposure anchor.
- `newsletter_signup`, `user_registration`, `onboarding_completed`, and
  `artist_profile_first_publish` are the only authoritative lifecycle outcomes.
  Automatic registration newsletter subscriptions remain excluded.

Every experiment row must carry exactly the canonical experiment key, surface,
and one declared variant. Assignment never implies exposure, and clicks or
pageviews never synthesize either event.

## Attribution

Rows are ordered by `created_at ASC, id ASC`. The first valid assignment fixes a
person's variant; duplicate and conflicting rows are diagnostics. Exposure must
strictly follow a matching assignment. Bridge clicks, route transitions, and
outcomes must strictly follow the applicable anchor, so pre-assignment outcomes
never attribute.

Identity resolves from payload `user_id`, stored `user_id`, then `visitor_id`.
A visitor stitches to a user only when the bounded window observes exactly one
user for that visitor. Ambiguous visitors remain separate. Lifecycle outcomes
deduplicate once per person, event type, and assignment/exposure lens.

Same-session attribution extends while identified pageviews remain within the
configured inactivity gap. The first later cross-blog pageview is classified as
a later-session transition. The report does not claim adjacency to an
unobserved browser action.

## Bounds And Coverage

The reader scans one explicit UTC window with stable `(created_at, id)` keyset
pagination, 500 rows per page, and a configurable hard `max_events` ceiling.
One extra row is used only as a truncation sentinel. Truncated output retains
observed counts and labels them truncated.

Each signal has independent instrumentation coverage. Missing event types and a
missing assignment cohort produce `null` rather than measured zero. Unidentified
rows, bot-stamped rows, ambiguous visitor mappings, rejected contract rows, and
unattributed exposures remain explicit diagnostics. GPC/DNT requests emit no
measured assignment or exposure and may omit visitor identity, so their excluded
population is intentionally not inferable from stored rows.
