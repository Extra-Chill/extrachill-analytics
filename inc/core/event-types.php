/**
 * Canonical Analytics Event-Name Contract
 *
 * SINGLE cross-plugin source of truth for the team-experience and
 * artist-funnel analytics event_type strings (Extra-Chill/extrachill-users#129).
 *
 * Why extrachill-analytics owns these names
 * -----------------------------------------
 * extrachill-analytics owns the analytics substrate: the events table and
 * the `extrachill/track-analytics-event` ability that EVERY emitter across
 * extrachill-users / -studio / -roadie / -artist-platform already calls at
 * runtime. That ability call is an existing hard runtime dependency on this
 * plugin — so referencing a constant defined here adds ZERO new coupling.
 * extrachill-analytics is also `Network: true` (active on every site), so
 * these constants are guaranteed defined wherever an emitter or reader runs.
 *
 * Defining the names ONCE here — and having every emit site AND every reader
 * reference the constant instead of a bare string literal — means a rename
 * happens in exactly one place and can never silently desync an emit from a
 * read (the "permanently-zero metric, no error" failure mode #129 is about).
 *
 * Consumers reference these constants directly. They do NOT need a local
 * string fallback: if extrachill-analytics were ever absent, the
 * `extrachill/track-analytics-event` ability would also be absent and each
 * emit helper's existing `if ( ! $ability ) { return 0; }` guard no-ops the
 * emit before the event_type is ever used.
 *
 * @package ExtraChill\Analytics
 * @since   0.5.0
